        description: 'The first public institution of higher education in Texas, the school opened for classes on October 4, 1876, as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (A.M.C.) under the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Act. It is classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education among "R1: Doctoral Universities \– Very high research activity" as of 2021. Over the following decades, the school increased in size and scope, expanding to its largest enrollment during WWII before its first significant stagnation in enrollment post-war. Enrollment expanded again in the 1960s under the leadership of President James Earl Rudder. During his tenure, the school desegregated, became coeducational, and dropped the requirement for participation in the Corps of Cadets. To reflect the institution\'s expanded roles and academic offerings, the Texas Legislature renamed the school to Texas A&M University in 1963. The letters "A&M", originally A.M.C. and short for "Agricultural and Mechanical College", are retained as a tribute to the university\'s former designation.',
